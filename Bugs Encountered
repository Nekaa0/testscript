At onboarding, I didn't need to provide OTP to successfully create my account. 
At onboarding, the password field requires uppercase, number and symbol, but the validation allowed me through when I provided just uppercase and number.
At onboarding the password field says 7 characters long but I can only create an account with at least 8 characters. 
BVN Validation field accepts alphabets and spaces.
I left my account logged in for a while and the system did not log me out, considering the delicacy of the application, Tokens should expire after a finite period of time. 
The phone number field, is not capped at 11 digits.
The field to enter account number expects 10 digits, but I can submit the form without providing 10 digits. 
Some of the fields that are drop downs, have the title of the field as an option. Eg. Title, Marital status, document type. 
The field for name of next of kin accepts just spaces. 
The OTP field should accept just numbers.
The information being displayed as status is not user friendly "PENDING_APPROVAL"
On the hamburger menu at the top right, clicking settings takes the user to the history page.
